## Description

The todo-list app is a simple but very practical project that was created for the youcode course. It was based on Vanilla JS. Includes ES6+ features: const, let, blocks, and arrow functions. I don't use more advanced solutions, instead when writing code I put special emphasis on the use of accepted conventions and good practices.

The correctness of my work is supervised by [Krzysztof Dąbrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabrowskisoftware) - an experienced Senior Software Engineer.
